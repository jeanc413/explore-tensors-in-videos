# Explore tensors in videos

This projects explores the idea of using tensors in videos. It uses Tucker decomposition to transform videos into a lower dimensional space. More specifically it utilizes the core matrix of tucker decomposition  as compressed version of the video. The code in this repository takes videos, decomposes them and then it utilizes K-means clustering to group the cores. The aim is to check if this lower dimensional spaces are good representations of videos.


### Prerequisites

Before running the code some libraries have to be installed

Tensorly: a library used to compute the decompostions

With pip 
```
pip install -U tensorly
```

With conda

```
conda install -c tensorly tensorly
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
